### FAQ

1. **What are the indended use cases for this?** 
		A straight-forward and easy to use implementation of sending contact form submissions on Laravel projects with the use of Tailwind and Vue.js. Use cases range from simple lead generation forms, contact request forms to forms that collect files (uploads) and for event planning as well as reservations (date and time picker).

2. **The form is not sending with the error: "Invalid site key or not loaded in api.js"**
		Please use a valid reCAPTCHA key if you'd like to use reCAPTCHA validation in your form. If you want to use test keys, please refer to the documentation https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq?hl=en and use these keys in the .env file:
		Site key: 6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI
